Lightning Detector Sofware
==========================

This directory contains a collection of software to run and detect possible 
lightning with the Boltek EMF-100 atmospheric electric field monitor.  This
software provides a alternative to the Windows-only "EFM-100 Atmospheric 
Electric Field Monitor V1.18 Software".

Contents
--------
emf.c
  C source code for opening up a serial port (/dev/ttyS0), reading in the 
  electric field data, and averaging it over one second intervals.  The code
  also computes the change in the electric field from one second to the next.

spinningCan.py
  Python script for interfacing with a Boltek EFM-100 via serial port and serving
  up the data via multicast UDP.

spinningCanCLI.py
  Python script to print out the packets comming from spinningCan.py on the command 
  line if no GUI is wanted or possible.

spinningCanGUI.py
  Python script based on pySerial wxTerminal.py example that reads in from a 
  a multicast UDP address (224.168.2.9, port 7164) and prints out field and 
  warning notices.

spinningCanTest.py
  Python scirpt to serve up fake lightning data so that the various interfaces can 
  be tested without actually hooking up a Boltek EFM-100.
