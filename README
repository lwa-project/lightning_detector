Lightning Detector Software
===========================

This directory contains a collection of software to run and detect possible 
lightning with the Boltek EFM-100 atmospheric electric field monitor.  This
software provides a alternative to the Windows-only "EFM-100 Atmospheric 
Electric Field Monitor V1.18 Software".

Contents
--------
emf.c
  C source code for opening up a serial port (/dev/ttyS0), reading in the 
  electric field data, and averaging it over one second intervals.  The code
  also computes the change in the electric field from one second to the next.

spinningCan.py
  Python script for interfacing with a Boltek EFM-100 via serial port and serving
  up the data via multi-cast UDP.

spinningCanCLI.py
  Python script to print out the packets coming from spinningCan.py on the command 
  line if no GUI is wanted or possible.

spinningCanGUI.py
  Python script based on pySerial wxTerminal.py example that reads in from a 
  a multi-cast UDP address (224.168.2.9, port 7164) and prints out field and 
  warning notices.

spinningCanGUI2.py
   Like spinningCanGUI.py, but has seperate plot windows for the electric field and 
   its derivative.

spinningCanTest.py
  Python script to serve up fake lightning data so that the various interfaces can 
  be tested without actually hooking up a Boltek EFM-100.

spinningCanReplay.py
  Python script to replay a spinningCan.py recording of the raw electric field values
  over multi-cast UDP.

analyzeRecoding.py
   Script that takes in a recoding generated by spinningCan.py and does lightning 
   detection on the recorded values.  Useful for testing new detection methods.
