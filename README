Lightning Detector Sofware
==========================

This directory contains a collection of software to run and detect possible 
lightning with the Boltek EMF-100 atmospheric electric field monitor.  This
software provides a alternative to the Windows-only "EFM-100 Atmospheric 
Electric Field Monitor V1.18 Software".

Contents
--------
emf.c
  C source code for opening up a serial port (/dev/ttyS0), reading in the 
  electric field data, and averaging it over one second intervals.  The code
  also computes the change in the electric field from one second to the next.

spinningCan.py
  Python script based on pySerial wxTerminal.py example that reads in from a 
  user-selectable serial port and prints out the electric field and the change 
  in the electric field at a rate of ~10 times per second.  This script uses the
  spinningCan.wxg wxGlade design file for its interface.

wxSerialConfigDialog.py
  Python script from the pySerial examples used by spinningCan.py for setting 
  the parameters for the serial port.
